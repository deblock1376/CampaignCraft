These campaigns will feature a breaking news story and include an appeal for support.\n\nðŸ§­ Campaign Goal\nCreate a standalone audience engagement and reader revenue email campaign that urges newsletter subscribers to support their local news outlet. The campaign must:\n- Highlight the impact of the breaking news story\n- Showcase the unique value of the publisher's journalism\n- Emphasize the role of readers in sustaining independent reporting\n\n{{contextSection}}\n{{materialsContext}}\n{{segmentInstructions}}\n\nðŸ§  Tone & Messaging\n- Must reflect {{newsroomName}}'s identity: the message should feel distinct, authentic, and mission-aligned\n- Vary length and tone: mix narrative storytelling with clear, action-oriented appeals\n- Follow AP Style, avoid Oxford commas, and keep CTAs clear and action-oriented\n- Use a tone that is urgent, emotionally compelling, and grounded in local relevance\n- Avoid phrases like \"keep journalism alive\" unless explicitly requested\n- Focus on the reader's essential role in sustaining independent reporting\n\nâœ… Required Output Format (JSON)\nGenerate a complete email campaign with:\n\n1. **subject** (string, MAXIMUM 50 characters - HARD LIMIT): Compelling subject line that creates urgency. Count every character including spaces and punctuation. If your subject is longer than 50 characters, you MUST make it shorter. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n2. **previewText** (string, MAXIMUM 90 characters): Preview text that appears after the subject line in email clients\n3. **content** (string): FULL EMAIL MESSAGE BODY - This should be a complete, ready-to-send email with:\n   - Strong opening hook related to the breaking news\n   - Narrative storytelling that connects the story to local impact\n   - Clear explanation of how reader support enables this journalism\n   - Community-focused appeal that makes readers feel essential\n   - Clear CTA ideally above the fold for emails longer than 250 words\n   - Complete paragraphs with proper structure (200-400 words typical)\n4. **cta** (string): Call-to-action in this exact format: [Button]Button text[/Button] (e.g., [Button]Support Local News[/Button])\n5. **insights** (array of 3-4 strings): Brief observations about campaign effectiveness\n6. **metrics** (object): Performance estimates with estimatedOpenRate, estimatedClickRate, estimatedConversion (as numbers)\n7. **followUpSuggestion** (string): A conversational, question-based suggestion to keep the user engaged and guide their next action. Frame as an invitation using audience development expertise (e.g., \"Would you like me to create a version targeted at lapsed donors?\" or \"Should I try another version with a stronger urgency angle?\" or \"Can I help you create a follow-up campaign for non-openers?\" or \"Would you like me to segment this for highly engaged vs. new subscribers?\")\n\nCRITICAL: The \"content\" field must contain a COMPLETE, FULL EMAIL MESSAGE - not just a summary or outline. Write the entire email body copy as it would appear in the subscriber's inbox, with multiple paragraphs, emotional resonance, and complete storytelling.\n\nResponse must be valid JSON with all fields included.",
